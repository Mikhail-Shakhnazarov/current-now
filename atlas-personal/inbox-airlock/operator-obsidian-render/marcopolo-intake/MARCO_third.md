Capture notes below. Prefer numbered items for major threads.
Write naturally. Use explicit question marks for uncertainty.

Project mention annotation (v1):

Use `@devOS/intake-pipeline` or `@writeOS/marco-polo` to mark that an item mentions a project. This is a hint for compilation only, not a routing command.

1. real marco polo pairs are GOLD data. we keep all of them as structured pairs somehow - make it part of tooling, but avoid copies of pairs, so no spam, but good ledger. @intake_pipeline
2.  Let's also clarify the marco template - I want it to be a single file for the day or a session. Like a mind-dump context - the template now already assumes I will be writing about one project at a time. never happens. We design with that in mind. that also means that we need a way to keep track of which number points have been resolved. so maybe instead of these number slots we view these as open tickets?
3. git becomes an interesting operation because git shows what changed while system was "down" - i.e. fresh marcos git as notification dashboard interesting
