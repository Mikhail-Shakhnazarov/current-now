Capture notes below. Prefer numbered items for major threads.
Write naturally. Use explicit question marks for uncertainty.

1.  real marco polo pairs are GOLD data. we keep all of them as structured pairs somehow - make it part of tooling, but avoid copies of pairs, so no spam, but good ledger. 
2.  Let's also clarify the marco template - I want it to be a single file for the day or a session. Like a mind-dump context - the template now already assumes I will be writing about one project at a time. never happens. We design with that in mind.
3. git becomes an interesting operation because git shows what changed while system was "down" - i.e. fresh marcos git as notification dashboard interesting
4. There should be a place for these kinds of system obervations, like these points are not project related, but I want to be able to pull on these threads let's use @ as a flag for projects - like @writeOS/marcopolo and maybe make some use of hashtags
