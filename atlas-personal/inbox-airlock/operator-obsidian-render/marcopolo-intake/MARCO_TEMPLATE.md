Source: Obsidian
Mode: freeform
Target project (optional): writeOS/marco-polo

Intent (one line):


---

Capture notes below. Prefer numbered items for major threads.
Write naturally. Use explicit question marks for uncertainty.

Project mention annotation (v1):

`@devOS/intake-pipeline` or `@writeOS/marco-polo` marks that an item mentions a project. This is a hint for compilation only, not a routing command.

Priority annotation (v1):

`PRIO: high|med|low` can be appended to an item line to mark priority as a hint for compilation and later promotion.

Direction block (optional):

A block starting with `BEGIN DIRECTION` and ending with `END DIRECTION` can be used for exploratory synthesis. Compilation should treat direction blocks as proposals and questions, not as authoritative facts.
