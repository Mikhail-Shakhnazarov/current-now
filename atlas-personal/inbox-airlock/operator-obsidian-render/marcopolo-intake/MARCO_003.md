Target project (optionalHERE THIS LETS REMOVE IF ITS OPTIONAL DONT TELL ME ITS OPTIONAL EVERYTJING IS OPTIONAL BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS INTENTIONAL): atlas general

Intent (one line):


---

Capture notes below. Prefer numbered items for major threads.
Write naturally. Use explicit question marks for uncertainty.

Project mention annotation (v1):

`@devOS/intake-pipeline` or `@writeOS/marco-polo` marks that an item mentions a project. This is a hint for compilation only, not a routing command.

Priority annotation (v1):

`PRIO: high|med|low` can be appended to an item line to mark priority as a hint for compilation and later promotion.

Direction block (optional):

A block starting with `BEGIN DIRECTION` and ending with `END DIRECTION` can be used for exploratory synthesis. Compilation should treat direction blocks as proposals and questions, not as authoritative facts.

1. git as differentiator (see git commit messages history for detail)

2.  

3.
