# Now: self-explaining-software

## Current State

New writeOS project initialized. Seed plan copied from Atlas-TUI sandbox:
- specs/play-plan.md

This project is for system practice: self-explaining software via observability,
lightweight checks, and binding schemas (3D-printing approach).

## Intent

- Generalize the Atlas-TUI play plan into a reusable system practice.
- Define the standard artifacts (event vocabulary, debug snapshots, binding schema).
- Produce a minimal onboarding pack (WELCOME_PACK) for new operators.

## Next

1. Review specs/play-plan.md and extract system-wide principles into a core spec.
2. Draft WELCOME_PACK.md for this project (cheap model onboarding).
3. Define a template for binding schema + smoke checks.
