## Open

OPEN-001: Define dissertation target requirements.

Closure: capture structure, citation style, formatting rules, and constraints.

OPEN-002: Define transformation stages and verification.

---

## Verification

- Project wrapper exists with `now.md`, `specs/`, `drafts/`, `schemas/`, `outputs/`, `logs/`, `.atlas/version`.
