# Now: marco-polo

## Current State

writeOS pilot project.

Inputs are copied into `drafts/`:
- `drafts/marco.md` (operator note)
- `drafts/polo.md` (derived breakdown)

## Intent

Work on the semantic relationship between marco and polo:
- Evaluate mapping fidelity (coverage, non-invention, decomposition quality)
- Define an analysis workflow that can become tooling (subsidiarity)

## Next

1. Work from `specs/SPEC-001.md` (design question).
2. Decide the evaluation rubric (coverage/fidelity/routing/open-items discipline).
3. Produce a trace map from `marco.md` items to `polo.md` sections.
4. Identify what can be delegated to deterministic tooling.

## v2

See `outputs/challenge.md` for the portable challenge statement with acceptance criteria.
