# Projects Index

Operator: Mikhail Shakhnazarov
Year: 2026

This is the human index of projects. Each project lives in a wrapper folder.

Taxonomy:
- `devOS/` for software projects
- `writeOS/` for writing/transform projects
- `self/` for work on the system itself
- `project to import/` is staging (to be migrated into devOS/writeOS)

## devOS

- `devOS/task-timer/` -- active
  - Now: `devOS/task-timer/now.md`
  - Specs: `devOS/task-timer/specs/`
  - Client repo: `devOS/task-timer/repo/`

## writeOS

- (none yet)

## self

- `self/` -- meta
  - Notes: `self/README-STUB.md`

## Staging

- `project to import/` -- staging area for incoming repos
