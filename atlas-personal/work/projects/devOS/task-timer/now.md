# Now: task-timer

## Current State

The client-facing repository has been wrapped into a project system nest.

- Client repo lives at `repo/`
- System artifacts live alongside at `now.md`, `specs/`, `logs/`, and `.atlas/`

## Next

1. Confirm the wrapper structure is correct and stable.
2. Decide whether to keep specs in Markdown only or migrate to schema-valid JSON specs.
3. If continuing feature work, interpret the next operator request into a new spec.
