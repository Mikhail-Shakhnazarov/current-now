# Now: compaction

## Current State

Project stub created.

Compaction is a cross-cutting pattern: high-dimensional input -> constrained representation -> deterministic propagation -> engineered context.

Note on term drift: the MARCO/POLO pipeline is a concrete compaction instance. This project treats "compaction" as the umbrella term and keeps explicit links to the MARCO/POLO work to avoid drift.

## Links

- `work/projects/writeOS/marco-polo/specs/SPEC-001.md`
- `work/projects/devOS/intake-pipeline/specs/SPEC-001.md`

## Next

1. Define the compaction interface (inputs, constraints, outputs, verification).
2. Identify canonical examples (MARCO->POLO, context packs, multimodal binding).
3. Decide what becomes tooling vs documentation.
