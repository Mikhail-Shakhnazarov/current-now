# PLAN PROTOCOL (OPENCODE)

Plan mode is the scoping and phased planning layer between interpretation and execution.

The intent is to turn a structured project intent (polo) into a concrete, reviewable implementation plan and a spec draft that can later be executed.

In v2 this protocol is a stub used to shape prompt composition and to define expected outputs. Full schema validation and spec writing will be implemented later.

## Output Contract (v2 stub)

Primary output is a short, scannable plan in chat and an optional file artifact written outside the managed repo (project wrapper logs/specs).

## Rules

Avoid guessing. Unclear assumptions become OPEN items.

Prefer explicit phases with verification checkpoints.
