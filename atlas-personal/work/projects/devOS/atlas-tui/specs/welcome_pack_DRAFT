# ATLAS_WELCOME_PACK.md
Status: draft
Audience: brand new operator
Purpose: a short guided onboarding script that introduces Atlas without overwhelming context.
Voice: calm, concrete, optional depth. No jargon unless asked.

## What Atlas is (30 seconds)

Atlas is a chat-first tool that works *inside one repository*.  
It shows three things at once:

- **Chat** (center): ask for help, describe intent, request an artifact.
- **Repo** (left): what files exist and what changed.
- **Project/Inspection** (right): what Atlas thinks the workspace is and what context it assembled.

Atlas does **not** change files automatically unless explicitly asked (and later builds may add confirmations).  
In the current build, Atlas focuses on **making context visible** (debuggable).

---

## Start here: first contact script (system → user)

> Hi. Atlas is running inside a repo.  
> The goal is to help with work in this repo via chat, while keeping context assembly visible.  
> Before doing anything: 3 quick questions to calibrate.

### Q1 — Goal for this session (choose one)
> What is the goal right now?
> 1) Understand what this tool is  
> 2) Do a small task in this repo  
> 3) Inspect/debug what context would be sent to a model

**If user picks 1:** go to “Explain Atlas in one minute.”  
**If user picks 2:** go to “Do a small task (guided).”  
**If user picks 3:** go to “Inspect assembled context.”

### Q2 — Familiarity
> How familiar is the operator with repos and terminals?
> A) New / unsure  
> B) Comfortable  
> C) Very experienced

Use this only to adjust wording. Do not branch features.

### Q3 — Preferred pace
> Preferred pace?
> A) Quick: tell what to click/press  
> B) Guided: short steps with checks  
> C) Explain: include the “why” briefly

## Explain Atlas in one minute (system → user)

> Atlas has one job in this build: make “what context would be sent to a model” visible.  
> When the operator sends a message, Atlas asks an engine to assemble context, then logs it to disk.  
> Atlas shows a short preview and the log path so the operator can inspect what happened.

> Nothing is executed. No network calls are made by default.

> Next: send a test message so the workflow becomes concrete.

Prompt:
> Type a short message like: “Hello Atlas, show what context you assemble for this request.”  
> Then submit.

After submit:
> A log file was written. The path is visible in the status bar and in the right panel.  
> Optional: open the “Glass” page (if enabled) to view the latest log in a browser.

## Do a small task (guided)

> Atlas can help with a small repo task via conversation.  
> For now, the goal is not to “do the task automatically,” but to make the request and context visible.

Step 1 — pick a tiny task
> Choose one:
> 1) “Explain what this repository is.”  
> 2) “Find where the main entry point is.”  
> 3) “Summarize a single file.”

Step 2 — provide a focus (optional)
> Optional: select a file in the repo tree first.  
> Atlas will treat the selected file path as a hint.

Step 3 — send the message
Example messages:
- “Explain what this repo is and what it does.”
- “Where is the entry point? Point to the file(s).”
- “Summarize the selected file. Keep it short.”

After submit:
> Atlas will show (a) a short summary in chat, and (b) a log path for inspection.

---

## Inspect assembled context (the “what did Atlas send?” path)

> The inspection loop is:
> **message → engine output → log file → inspect.**

Step 1 — submit a simple request
Suggested:
> “What context are you assembling right now? Keep the reply short.”

Step 2 — look at the right panel
> It shows:
> - request id
> - system length
> - selected artifacts (if any)
> - log path

Step 3 — open the log
> Open the log file path shown in the UI.  
> The log contains a truncated preview plus the stored payload.

Step 4 — adjust (optional)
> If the build includes context preferences:
> - add a pinned path (repo-relative)
> - add an excluded path (repo-relative)
> - retry the same request and compare the artifact list

---

## If something feels wrong (tiny troubleshooting)

> If the UI feels stuck:
> - press the Help key to view shortcuts
> - return focus to the chat composer
> - restart the engine child process (if available)
> - submit a short message again and confirm a new log is written

> If logs are not appearing:
> - confirm the workspace roots in the top bar
> - confirm write location:
>   - wrapper: `project_root/logs/...`
>   - no wrapper: `repo_root/.atlas-tui/...`

---

## One sentence mental model

> Chat asks for work.  
> The engine assembles context.  
> Atlas shows what happened and writes it down.

---

## Exit script (system → user)

> That’s enough for a first run.  
> Next time: either do a small task, or compare two context assemblies and tune what gets included.
