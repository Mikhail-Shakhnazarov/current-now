1. we need to improve standard system output to be friendly to whatever mechanism opencode are using
2. we need to consider a subsidiarity angle - we delegate to explicit deterministic tooling where can delegate "lowest level of authority" in subsidiarity is a bit more black and white here because here agency and authority are binary - operator termination.
3. we can also tell a lot from the opencode context composition view as it is. Open code is an opensource project. We can fork and assimilate (with attribution and here how do you even do attribution??) their implementation and see what other data we can expose.  simple deterministic Tooling can then log what we want it to log. same about the contents of the raw messages between user and assistant in the opencode contetx view pane
4. we also need to discuss the idea that wat determines model choice here is not necessarily size, but the degree to which we want the role to engage at a cognitive level. Free models like grok1 should be used where application (both the interpretive and the executive stages) is simple, like working on some specific coding project - here there is no need for "deep system context"
5. this makes me think of context depth and context bredth as orthogonal controls. We have context volume as a composite measure. the goal is to match the context volume to the task and goal, given intention.
6. Ab important consideration is that we have a sequential process. A necessarily sequential process. Like a CPU appropriate process. So here scaling become a question of threads, cores, and parallel kernels plus the atlas-os as orchestrator. 
7. Let's also consider output templates. For devos, what kind of projects will I be building? We want a template for typescript plus Google apps script template for the consulting ecosystem, a music template for supercollider, a web-ui template. For writeOS, one interesting output format and template could be a research/thought/idea dump for a rag interrogation / research tool like notebookLM. Importantly, if we define how we wantthe response to be structured, we can export part of the input hygiene pipeline and expect cleaner system compatible response form external substrate tools. It's all about context handoff for writeOS. So we have two output format ty for writeOS - context packs for further processing and human facing end products - papers, etc. 
8. Good. We use work os as the development playground for context engineering. Proven techniques imply or convert to s tooling via subsidiarity. 
9. I want to do two things: I want this to be a "kind of" operator input - this would be flowing text, semi structured - multiple themes, etc interwoven. I will want to see some feedback surface for that, like a breakdown into separate system threads that make sense. For now, let's use the polo file (same directory for now) as response. I think a good way to describe the metagoal here is as a breakdown of such input into themes and attaching the them to the project where releveant, etc. Like some preprosessing - after all, this current role instance has all the system context and local conventions, etc necessary to achieve that, no? The cool thing is that I am not looking for answers from this stage of the process - I am looking for cleared up signal of operator input and project stages.
