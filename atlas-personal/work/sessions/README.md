# Sessions

Compressed work history for re-entry.

## Purpose

Sessions capture completed work in loadable form. When returning after time gap, load recent sessions to restore context without replaying conversation.

## Format

```
YYYYMMDD_HHMM_<project>_<slug>.md
```

## Contents

Each session brief contains:
- Intent -> action -> outcome summary
- Decisions made (explicit)
- Friction encountered
- Verification results
- Next actions

## Usage

Sessions load into interpreter projection for reference resolution. "What we decided" resolves to session decisions. "Where we left off" resolves to session next actions.
